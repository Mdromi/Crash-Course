TypeScript is a programming language that is a super set of JavaScript. It is developed and maintained by Microsoft. TypeScript adds optional static typing and class-based object-oriented programming to the JavaScript language.

Here are some key concepts in TypeScript:

__Main Concept__
- Types
- Type Alias
- Interfaces
- Extend
- Marge
- Unions
- Narrowing
- Generic
- Assertion
- Structural Typing / Duck Typing

1.Types: In TypeScript, you can specify the type of a variable when it is declared, such as number, string, or boolean. This helps catch type-related errors at compile-time, rather than runtime.

2.Interfaces: An interface in TypeScript defines the structure of an object, including the names and types of its properties and methods. Interfaces allow you to create contracts for the shape of an object, and ensure that objects that are used in your code adhere to that contract.

3.Classes: TypeScript supports object-oriented programming, including the use of classes and inheritance. A class is a blueprint for creating objects, and you can use inheritance to create a new class based on an existing class, with the new class having all the features of the base class and additional features of its own.

4.Modules: A module in TypeScript is a way to organize your code and create reusable components. A module can contain variables, functions, and classes, and can be imported into other parts of your program.

5.Decorators: A decorator is a special kind of function that can be used to modify the behavior of a class or its members. Decorators are a way to add additional functionality to your code in a declarative way, without having to make changes to the underlying implementation.
